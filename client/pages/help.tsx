                Chicken Jockey is a typing-based racing minigame where players race chickens by typing text prompts
                accurately and quickly. It's inspired by Minecraft's chicken jockey mob and designed as both a web-based 
                multiplayer game and a Minecraft-integrated minigame.
              </p>
              <p>
                The game features customizable chickens and jockeys, XP-based progression, and a unique system where 
                players create the text prompts for future races.

                    Typing speed is calculated in Words Per Minute (WPM). In Chicken Jockey, we use the standard
                    definition where 1 word equals 5 characters. Your WPM is calculated by dividing the number of
                    characters you've typed by 5, then dividing by the elapsed time in minutes.
